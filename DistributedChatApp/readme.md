# Distributed Chat Application
- designed and implemented a simulated distributed chat system enabling multiple users to communicate across independently hosted chat sessions.
- each chat session operates on its own server, with support for seamless user switching between active chat rooms
- Technologies Used: Python, gRPC, Tkinter

#### How to Run:
- download the project folder from this repo, and then proceed to the folder on a terminal session
- note that you will need a separate terminal session for each client and each server
- to start the server, enter `python server.py` (on some computers, you may have to use `python3` instead)
- to start the client, enter `python client.py` (on some computers, you may have to enter `python3` instead)
